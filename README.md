# Simulated Annealing

This project contains an implementation of a local search algorithm, simulated annealing, on the N queens problem.

## What is Simulated Annealing?
[Simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) is a local search algorithm used for optimization problems.

## Inspiration for this project
The motivation and inspiration for this project came from one of my courses, **Artificial Intelligence: Principles & Techniques** (AIPT; Radboud University, SOW-BKI259).
